# Brigadier-pp

A re-implementation of Brigadier in cpp

## Status

This project is before anything a school project, therefore it is in its
early stage and not a lot works for now. Most of the stuff made here could also
already exists somewhere else but reimplemented here for the sake of having
something to work on. I would therefore not recommend anyone using it
for now, but **contributions are more than welcome** ;).

## Building

Currently **only Linux x86_64 and FreeBSD** are targeted, it might build on another system
but it isn't guaranted for now.

### Dependencies

Here is the list of dependencies required to build CubicServer:

 - gcc12/g++12 or clang15/clang++15 (Minimum versions, above should work too, but below will definitely not)
 - cmake (The build system)
 - make (Building system, you might work without but it is not tested)
 - pkgconf (Cmake package shenanigans)
 - git (Cloning deps)

To install those dependencies you can see an example for Fedora 38 from our
[build image](https://github.com/CubicMC/cubic-runners/blob/master/Dockerfile)

## Contributing

Any contributions are welcome, if you don't know what to do you can take a look
at our issues tab and start talking in one of them to contribute :D.
